Tested and working for:
degree = 8;
plaintext = 257
ciphertext = 799 999 999

//257, 337, 353, 401, 433, 449, 577, 593, 641, 673, 881,

multiplication, addition, multiplication


Todo:
1. Implement homomorphic comparison and homomorphic subtraction
2. Create a more friendly interface of the scheme to work with and override the default operations - add, mult, compare, subtr
3. Improve the noise growth using https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/204.pdf  and the RNS representation
